## What is a DiscoTech?

DiscoTech is short for **Disco**ver **Tech**nology, and it's an opportunity to find out about local technology projects that address civic issues, about open data, and about local technology policies & issues.

Created by the Detroit Digital Justice Coalition (part of Allied Media Projects), DiscoTechs are a replicable model, and are designed so that participants learn more about the impact and possibilities of technology within our communities. DiscoTechs feature interactive, multimedia workshops designed to demystify, engage, and inform the community about issues of Internet use and ownership, and our communications rights on and offline."

### The Seattle DiscoTech will include:

- a civic tech fair featuring projects & organizions that seek to improve local civic engagement
- an assortment of activities for learning about javascript, open data, & other topics

### Why not a hackathon?

Seattle has many hackathons, and previously our event for the National Day of Civic Hacking has been a hackathon. This year our goal is to hold an event that's more inclusive, has more activities available for those who don't write code, and is more inviting to people with the myriad of skills beyond writing code that is needed for supporting and improving civic engagement.
